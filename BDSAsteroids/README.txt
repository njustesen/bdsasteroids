| | * The ingame menu is unresponsive! We have not implemented an ingame    | |
| |   menu, so all buttons except from "exit game" is unresponsive during   | |

| | * If the screen is flat - this can easily be noticed by looking at the  | |

| | * If the game cannot start, it might be because it cannot find a        | |
| |   fitting resolution. Read the "system requirements" section.           | |

| |   When bullets are fired, the shooters speed is added to the            | |
| |   bullet. Because of the UFO's special way of moving, bullets           | |
| |   are fired at the same speed in each direction, not depended           | |
| |   on the speed and rotation. This makes the speed of the UFO-           | |
| |   bullets the same for each rotation.                                   | |
